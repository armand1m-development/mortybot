# mortybot

Mortybot is a fun bot with a bunch of utilities and features stolen from other
bots that eventually became paid or just lacked the experience me and my friends
wanted in our groups.

It is also inspired by other bots I've seen in the wild during my work
experiences and past implementations.

This bot is available in Telegram as
[@MortyBot](https://t.me/MortyBrasileiroBot) and it works in multiple groups.
Keep in mind that a select group of me and my friends own this instance and
manage the data accordingly.

## Developing

Make sure you have Git and Deno 1.31+ available in your local environment.

```sh
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/armand1m/mortybot.git

# cd into it
cd ./mortybot

# make sure you have deno installed
which deno

# make sure you're on 1.31+
deno --version
```

You must have a Telegram Bot Token created by the Bot Father. Once you have
that, run the following command with your bot token:

```sh
cat > ./.env <<EOL
BOT_TOKEN=0000000000:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
EXCHANGE_API_TOKEN=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_TOKEN=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
DATA_PATH=./data
MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_ENABLED=true
MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_IN_MINUTES=2
EOL
```

Now you should be able to run the bot:

```sh
deno task dev
```

## Deploying

### Host

Follow the same configuration step for development, but first override your .env
with this:

```sh
cat > ./.env <<EOL
BOT_TOKEN=0000000000:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
EXCHANGE_API_TOKEN=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_TOKEN=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
DATA_PATH=./data
MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_ENABLED=true
MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_IN_MINUTES=2
EOL
```

and run it with deno:

```sh
deno task start
```

You probably want to use a process manager like `systemd`.

### Docker

This bot is published publicly as a Docker Image, so you should be able to run
it anywhere you can run a Docker Container.

To run it locally, just run the following:

```sh
# create a volume to persist data
docker volume create mortybot_data

# (optional) build image from source
docker build . -t armand1m/mortybot

# run the container
docker run \
  -e BOT_TOKEN="your-bot-token-here" \
  --mount source=mortybot_data,target=/app/data \
  armand1m/mortybot
```

### Fly

This bot is published in https://fly.io

The CI will take care of publishing the last main branch state into the official
bot release.

Publishing it in your instance should be easy:

```sh
# get credentials
fly auth login

# set bot token from @BotFather as a secret
#
# secrets in fly are automatically added to
# the instance as env vars with the same name
fly secrets set BOT_TOKEN=123123123:32132132131312

# create a volume to hold persistent group data
# 1gb is more than enough.
fly vol create mortybot_data -s 1

# ship it
fly deploy
```

Refer to https://fly.io docs for more details on other commons operations.
